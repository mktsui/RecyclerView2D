# RecyclerView2D

The project was created with Kotlin using MVVM design pattern. It is a 2D recycler view which clicking video item will open a video detail fragment with enter/exit animation. Image async loading was done with Volley, and Mockito was used for unit testing for the view model business logic and dataset, for scenarios where bad results are received.
